================

An OpenFrameworks example using ofAssimpModelLoader showing how to manually render a 3D mesh for manipulating purposes.

- Black dots are vertexes
- Blue dots are ofMeshFace centroids
- Blue lines are face normals
- Faces are white transparent

The basics are working correctly but there's currently an issue with getting the normals from the ofMeshFaces.
They're weirdly oriented.
